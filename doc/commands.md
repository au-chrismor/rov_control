# COMMANDS

## DOWN

Runs the vertical motor "Reverse", which descends the ROV.  Horizontal state is unchanged.

## FWD

Runs horizontal motors in "Forward" direction.  Moves ROV forwards.  Vertical state is unchanged.

## LEFT

Turns ROV to the left.  Vertical state is unchanged.

## LL+

Motor Trim: Increases the PWM rate for the "L" direction on the *left* horizontal motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## LL-

Motor Trim: Decreases the PWM rate for the "L" direction on the *left* horizontal motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## LON

Turns on the external light.

## LOFF

Turns off the external light.

## LR+

Motor Trim: Increases the PWM rate for the "R" direction on the *left* horizontal motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## LR-

Motor Trim: Decreases the PWM rate for the "R" direction on the *left* horizontal motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## HSTOP

Stops the horizontal motors.  Vertical state is unchanged.

## LOG

Returns current sensor readings.

## REV

Runs horizontal motors in "Reverse" direction.  Moves ROV backwards.  Vertical state is unchanged.

## RIGHT

Turns ROV to the right.  Vertical state is unchanged.

## RL+

Motor Trim: Increases the PWM rate for the "L" direction on the *right* horizontal motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## RL-

Motor Trim: Decreases the PWM rate for the "L" direction on the *right* horizontal motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## RR+

Motor Trim: Increases the PWM rate for the "R" direction on the *right* horizontal motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## RR-

Motor Trim: Decreases the PWM rate for the "R" direction on the *right* horizontal motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## SAVE

Saves current trim settings to EEPROM.

## STOP

Stops all motors

## UP

Runs the vertical motor "Forward", which ascends the ROV.  Horizontal state is unchanged

## VL+

Motor Trim: Increases the PWM rate for the "L" direction on the vertical motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## VL-

Motor Trim: Decreases the PWM rate for the "L" direction on the vertical motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## VR+

Motor Trim: Increases the PWM rate for the "R" direction on the vertical motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## VR-

Motor Trim: Decreases the PWM rate for the "R" direction on the vertical motor.  Values are not automatically saved to EEPROM, see the "SAVE" command.

## VSTOP

Stops the vertical motor.  Horizontal state is unchanged
